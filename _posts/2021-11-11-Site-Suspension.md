Hi there! My name is Robert. I am currently interested in oncology informatics. This blog covers a broad range of topics include bioinformatics and infrastructures that support heavy computational tasks. I will also share some of my other personal interests, which include but are not limited to artistic coffee brewing and piloting.


### Temporary suspension of this site
This site will no be maintained until further notice, however the topics on oncology informatics are still continuing at [DPP4 Research Gateway](https://dpp4researchgroup.github.io/DPP4-HomePage/), I hope to see you there.
